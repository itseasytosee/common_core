>"How will Man's subconscious mind react to his first experiences with space travel? Will he not suddenly be aware of his precarious situation, trapped in a tiny metal box, floating through the incomprehensible nothingness of space?"

# Space Madness
The trials and tribulations that one must endure during their career working in space are surely damaging to one’s mindstate. Nanotrasen’s stations are no exception. Through the tedium of work, the inhumane living conditions, and the bloodshed. An individual will develop some cracks in their psyche. And sometimes, though these cracks, something terrifying will slip in.

# Beyond the veil
These horrors are not from here. Not birthed from any planet or star but rather another plane of existence. Some scientists believe that these beings’ home is connected to bluespace technology, due to its frequent utilization and the rise of cults to these horrors beginning occurring at around the same time. Others say that this other place is less tangible and more of a manifestation of human consciousness, ideals, and fears. There has also been speculation that this other plane (or planes) are linked to the magic of the Wizards Federation and other practitioners.

These horrors are shown to have increased influence in certain areas where the veil between worlds is weakest. These tend to be in areas where fear, paranoia, and bloodshed are prevalent. Madness overtakes weakminded individuals turning them into deranged cultists of whatever horror influenced them, or driving them to suicide. Multiple distinct documented entities have proved their influence over the years.

# Prominent entities
This section will be documenting most of the known entities that have had an influence on unfortunate souls and the cults that derived from them.


## Nar-sie
_AKA the Geometer_

Nar-sie is by far one of, if not the most prominent of these horrors. She is often referred to as female by her cultist although these beings from beyond the veil undoubtedly don’t conform with the human concept of genders. This is probably because she inspires some sort of twisted maternal vibe in her followers. She seems to be an embodiment of blood, pain, and self-sacrifice. Her cultist also references a “divine pattern” or “hidden shapes.” Her cultists are considered threats to the corporation and have always had a single hostile intent - To bring Nar-Sie herself from beyond the veil.

### Gifts of the Geometer

Cultists of Nar-Sie usually can fashion eldritch runes out of their blood. They also are shown to have the ability to infuse themself with eldritch power allowing them to incapaitate foes by tempoaraly cutting of circulation to his or her's brain and create items such as daggers and shackles out of nothing. Most dangerously, powerful Nar-Sians can bombard an incapacitated victim with psychic pain while linking them directly to Nar-Sie effectively creating a new cultist. This process however is quite intensive and usually requires multiple cultists to do it correctly.

### Cults of the Geometer

There is no single large cult of Nar-Sie. This is due primarily to their recklessness and eagerness to perform their dark matron’s work. As soon as a group of cultists reaches the point of confidence in which they could succeed in their unholy mission, or even just be a boon to their cause, they will attempt it. Most of these attempts will fail and end in the destruction of the cult. But as a cult is crushed, elsewhere one will surely arise. Rarely, mentaly reclusive cultists will develop a glimpse of sanity and act more like heralds and scholars than suicidal zealots. Many consider Nar-Sie as a guiding figure or a sorce of knowledge. These heralds are usually found to be a disgrace to the Geometer in the eyes of other cultists. This is because of the lack of ambition to complete their one goal. Heralds are still considered enemies of the corporation and are to be neutralized.

## Ratvar
_The Imprisoned God_

Ratvar was once a powerful entity competing with the likes of Nar-Sie. It resided on a plane known as “_Reebee_” or the “City of cogs.” Supposedly, it was a clockwork city made of brass in which its cultists could enter once they had realized its power. However, this plane was also Ratvar’s prison from which it yearned to escape. While Reebee is gone, it is assumed that other structures such as temples or engines of the cult's creation still exist although it is unknown if they still have the power once bestowed to them by Ratvar.

### The Cult of Ratvar

It is assumed that all of Ratvar’s cultists died with Reebee. The Cult of Ratvar was once a congregation of followers who managed to transcend to Reebee. They prepared for a ritual where they would fire up the engines of Reebee in a spot where the veil is weakest and free their god from its prison.

### The Fall of Reebee

The fall of Reebee was an event in which Reebee, Ratvar, and all of its cultists were stuck down by Nanotrasen. The cult was preparing Reebee for the freeing of Ratvar where the Veil was weak. Outpost 17, a small nanotrasen asteroid mining station was the target. Brave crewmembers managed to slip through the cracks in the veil and into the heart of Reebee with a bluespace artillery beacon in tow. With a desperate plea being sent out to a nearby security outpost, Reebee was obliterated along with the crewmembers of Outpost 17.

## Lesser entities

These entities are documented and may hold some power but are considered lesser threats due to unwillingness or inability to interact with mortals.

### Eldrich Gods
Very little is known about the so-called Eldritch Gods or “_Epochs_”. Certain practitioners of magic are said to use their power to fuel deranged rituals usually involving human sacrifice. It is to be noted that these practitioners don’t serve these gods but rather wrangle the indifferent Epoch’s power through rituals.

### Infernal Beings
Certain entities that have been identified as demons or devils have been seen on stations. It is unknown if these beings are connected to the likes of other beings beyond the veil or something else entirely. The sighting of such beings seems to line up more with the rise of the Wizard Federation than the invention of bluespace technology suggest a correlation.

### Yalp Elor
A collection of individuals calling themself the cult of Yalp Elor seemed to have supernatural divination powers. These cultists had grown in numbers for a few decades. The group was eventually discovered in a warehouse drenched in their blood with most of them dead after an anonymous tip. The living cultists were detained by the Spinward Stellar Coalition Interrogation. Most were executed at the pressuring of Nanotrasen. Interrogation has revealed that these cultists are aware of reserve a deep hatred of Nar-Sie and her cultists. The remaining few members of the cult are being held in Spinward superjails indefinity.
